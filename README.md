## 🚀 From Foundations to Advanced

This three-course journey provided:

**2020 - CS50x:** Core computer science fundamentals  
↓  
**2021-2022 - CS50 AI:** Machine learning and AI foundations  
↓  
**2021-2022 - CS50 Web:** Full-stack web development  
↓  
**2024-Present:** Applying these foundations to **GenAI and Agentic AI Systems**

## 🔗 Current Work

These courses established my foundation in computer science, AI, and web development. I'm now applying these skills to cutting-edge **Generative AI and LangChain-based agentic systems**.

**For my current projects, see:**
- [AI Research Assistant](link-when-ready) - Multi-agent LangChain system
- [Predictive Maintenance Agent](link-when-ready) - Production ML pipeline
- [Portfolio Website](link-when-ready) - Full showcase of current work

## 📝 Reflections

**What made this series valuable:**
- Progressive complexity building on previous courses
- Hands-on projects over theoretical lectures
- Real-world problem-solving approach
- Emphasis on best practices and code quality

**Evolution in my approach:**
- **Then (2020-2022):** Building ML models from scratch, traditional web MVC patterns
- **Now (2024+):** Leveraging LLMs, building autonomous agents, modern AI orchestration

**How I'd approach these projects today:**
- Integrate LLMs for enhanced functionality
- Use modern deployment practices (Docker, CI/CD)
- Implement comprehensive testing
- Apply agentic patterns where applicable
- Use type hints and modern Python features

## 🤝 Academic Integrity

This repository contains my original work completed as part of Harvard's CS50 course series. All code was written independently following the course's academic honesty policy.

**If you're currently taking any CS50 course:**
Please complete your own work. These solutions are shared for portfolio purposes and to demonstrate my learning journey, not to facilitate academic dishonesty.
