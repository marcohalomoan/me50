# Distinctiveness and Complexity

The project is completely different from the projects in CS50W since it is not intended to communicate with others. Instead, its goal is to provide a platform to aid chess players and communities to organize and participate in tournaments more easily. It is more complex than network (I believe the hardest project in the course) since each tournament has way more attributes than post in network, for example location, time control, slots, participant, and more. The attributes also affect the display in many ways such as when number participants equal to slots, the tournament page is closed, similarly when the tournament date has passed. Other than listing tournaments and sign up for them, the organizer can submit tournament report and the results for all tournaments are displayed in separate page. The result include the podium winners and number of points for each participant.
