## 🤝 Academic Integrity

This repository contains my original work completed as part of Harvard's CS50 course series. All code was written independently following the course's academic honesty policy.

**If you're currently taking any CS50 course:**
Please complete your own work. These solutions are shared for portfolio purposes and to demonstrate my learning journey, not to facilitate academic dishonesty.
