Hello, I am Marco Halomoan. I created an Android App named "KWOTZ". It comes from "quotes". As its name, the app provide users with life quotes from reliable sources, depends on their emotional state. It is super simple, the main page asking you to choose your feeling. For starting there are 5: happy, sad, angry, afraid, embarrassed, each having 4 relevant motivating quotes. It is using linear layout and basic interface.

In case you wondering, of course you could just type in *Google* like "sad quotes" but sometimes people are not really sure how they feel. So this app could provide some references. Possible developments/ improvements are adding more emotions, adding more quotes, improving the UI (recyclerView etc), or letting people add their own quotes and making it like social media for quotes.
